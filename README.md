# Gradient Agreement Filtering (GAF)

This package implements the Gradient Agreement Filtering (GAF) optimization
algorithm. GAF is a novel optimization algorithm that improves gradient-based
optimization by filtering out gradients of data batches that do not agree with
each other.

## Installation

### Toy Problems

We include a number of toy optimization problems in the `toy_problems` directory that
demonstrate GAF in practice. To run these problems, you will need to install the
requirements in the `requirements.txt` file in the `toy_problems` directory with

```bash
pip install -r toy_problems/requirements.txt
```

Then you can run any of the notebooks or scripts the folder.
